# Structure

In this folder, all data from the experiments and evaluations is collected.


## Paper

The folder `paper/` contains all results from our paper and has the following structure:

```
├── paper
│   ├── eval : Evaluation data reported in our paper (tables and plots); See Remark 1 below
│   ├── [properties] : Data of the experiments for the corresponding properties
|   │   ├── seed[i] : Data of the experiemnts with random seed `i`
|   │   |   ├── test_[j] : Data of the `j`th test split
|   |   |   │   ├── only_p1_single : Data of the single-task experiment
|   |   |   |   |   ├── data : Training, validation, and test sets; See Remark 2 below
|   |   |   |   |   ├── results : Predictions on the test sets
|   |   |   |   |   ├── model.pt : Best performing model
|   |   │   |   ├── aux_p_pad : Data of the non-random multitask experiment
|   |   |   |   |   ├── ...
|   |   │   |   ├── aux_p_random_pad : Data of the random multitask experiment       
|   |   |   |   |   ├── ...
```

***Remark 1:*** Due to non-deterministic behavior during GPU training, the values of MAE and RMSE for `only_p1_single` at a training fraction of 1% do not coincide in `YoungsModulus293K_Density293K` and `YoungsModulus293K_Density293K_RefractiveIndex`. For better comparison, the relative errors in `YoungsModulus293K_Denisty293K_RefractiveIndex` are therefore computed with respect to the values of `only_p1_single` in `YoungsModulus293K_Density293K`. 
The plots show the values of `only_p1_single` in `YoungsModulus293K_Density293K`.

*Remark 2:* The files `test_c.csv` and `val_c.csv` denote the complements of the test and validation set, respecively. That is, `test.csv` + `test_c.csv` = all data; `val.csv` + `val_c.csv` = `test_c.csv`.


## New experiments

Data generated by a new experiment will appear in this folder with a specified identifier `[ident]` as folder name (default is the current timestamp). It will have the same structure as `paper/`. Checkpoints of the corresponding models will be saved to `[ident]/[properties]/seed[i]/test_[j]/[exp]/checkpoints/`, where `exp` is `only_p1_single`, `aux_p_pad`, or `aux_p_random_pad`.
